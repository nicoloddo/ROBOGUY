Roboguy is a robot-killing robot. It gains consciousness and fights its programmed instincts
to destroy itself. Players can control Roboguy’s movement with arrow keys and fight the
autoaim by rotating with ‘a’ or ‘d’. The game mechanics involve missing the targets while
trying instead to hit yourself with edge-bouncing bullets.
